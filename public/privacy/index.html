            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

            <p><strong>Updated 14 May 2025</strong></p>

            <p>This text describes the functionality of swiped and how your information is used.</p>

            <p>Swiped does <em>not</em> collect any personal data that can be used to identify you. No information is shared with data brokers or any third parties.</p>

            <p>Swiped will connect to https://swiped.pics/ periodically to sync your statistics. However, no information about the contents, location (if any) and metadata is sent.</p>

            <h3>What data is sent:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Your overall statistics</li>
            <li>App Store Purchase Receipt</li>
            <li>Sync setting preference</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How we handle your overall statistics</h3>
            <p>We keep tally of your statistics in app and on our servers, as such information is incredibly useful to analyze how, and how many people are on our service.</p>

            <h3>How we handle your App Store Purchase Receipt</h3>
            <p>App Store Purchase Receipts are cryptographically signed pieces of data by Apple which we use to authenticate upon connecting to SYNC.</p>
            <p>These receipts do not contain information about you, your device or previous purchases. </p>
            <p>These receipts do contain the date of purchase, latest app version as of app purchase and proprietary verification keys by Apple.</p>

            <p>We store your receipt as SYNC. uses those tokens to fetch, store the latest data and progress of the app.</p>
            <p>Think of the receipts as a key to your account that you can only fetch.</p>

            <h3>What happens when you disable SYNC.?</h3>
            <p>As of writing this policy, there is no option to disable syncing.</p>
            <p>But this is how it is planned.</p>

            <p>When you disable sync, your device will communicate with the servers one last time to let the server know to not continue updating for other devices on the same account.</p>

            <p>When you reset the database, your data on the server is also deleted.</p>
